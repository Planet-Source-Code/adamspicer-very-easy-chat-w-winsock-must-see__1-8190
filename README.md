## VERY EASY CHAT W/ Winsock \*must see\*


</div>

### Description

I have tried and tried to get winsock to connect for over a month now. And finally i got it down! I commented on every line of code. I didnt add anything special to the chat just because i dont want to complicate things for people who ONLY are looking on how to connect using Winsock. please vote for me! thanx
